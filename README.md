# Motivation

Given the age where we have a wide range of classes and events to attend, keeping track of events which we have to attend can be a burden on the memory. Sometimes, we also fail to prioritise our schedule properly. In addition, the hectic lifestyles make it difficult for us to find common free time together, whether it is for leisure activities or a formal meeting. It is also a hassle to manually look for free time with someone.


## And that's where planNUS steps in!

We aim to make event planning easy for students and academic staff by giving them in-depth info about events relevant to them as well as proffering them suggestions on what they could do as well as expediting the process of organising mutual events among themselves. In addition, we aim to ease the process of finding mutually convenient time with any user of the application.
